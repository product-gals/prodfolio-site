## What is Prodfolio?

Prodfolio is a purpose-built portfolio platform for product managers. Unlike general tools (Notion, Squarespace, Webflow, Canva), Prodfolio is designed around how PMs actually work and what hiring managers actually want to see.

Users create a portfolio at app.prodfolio.io/p/[username] and can share it with hiring managers, recruiters, and other stakeholders.

## Core Features

### AI-Powered Case Study Generation
Users upload product documents (PRDs, product briefs, project plans) and Prodfolio's AI extracts key information to generate structured case study drafts. Includes automatic data extraction, smart structure suggestions, and unlimited AI generations on paid plans.

### SIGNAL Framework
Prodfolio's proprietary case study framework: Situation, Insight, Goals, Navigation, Achievement, Learnings. Guided prompts walk users through each step so they capture exactly what hiring managers want to see.

### Portfolio Analytics
Track portfolio performance: total views, unique visitors, case study engagement, traffic sources (LinkedIn, direct, referral), resume downloads, and LinkedIn click tracking. Week-over-week momentum metrics included.

### Customization
5+ professional themes, custom accent colors, personal headshot and intro video support, custom domain (e.g. yourname.com) on higher-tier plans.

### NDA-Safe Sharing & Privacy Controls
Individual case studies can be locked so only specific people can view them. Enables PMs to share confidential work without violating NDAs. Each portfolio has a public shareable link at app.prodfolio.io/p/[username].

### Resume Upload
Users can attach their resume directly to their portfolio so hiring managers have everything in one place.
